# 🧠 AI-Powered Credit Risk Prediction Project

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict credit delinquency risk using customer financial data. Built as part of a virtual internship with **Tata iQ on Forage**, this system demonstrates a responsible, data-driven approach to identifying high-risk customers.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

In the financial services sector, identifying and proactively managing delinquent accounts is crucial. This ML-powered solution leverages customer credit data to:

- Predict likelihood of delinquency using classification models.
- Identify high-risk segments using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Compare model performances and visualize insights.
- Support responsible, ethical financial decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains anonymized customer-level financial features such as:

- `Income`
- `Credit_Score`
- `Credit_Utilization`
- `Missed_Payments`
- `Debt_to_Income_Ratio`
- `Delinquent_Account` *(Target variable)*

## 📌 Key Correlations

- Moderate positive correlation between `Missed_Payments` and `Delinquent_Account`.
- High credit utilization and low income were found as strong indicators of delinquency.
